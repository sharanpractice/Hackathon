## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### Project Name
Go Greet REST API

### Overview
The **Go Greet REST API** is a lightweight RESTful application designed in Go to demonstrate the creation of a simple API. This API will provide a greeting message in response to an HTTP GET request. The application will have a single endpoint, `/greet`, which returns a JSON response with a greeting message.

### Objectives
- Develop a RESTful API using Go that listens on a specified port.
- Implement a single endpoint, `/greet`, that responds with a greeting message.
- Ensure the API is lightweight, fast, and simple to deploy.

### Requirements

#### Functional Requirements
1. **Endpoint**: `/greet`
   - **Method**: `GET`
   - **Response**: JSON object with a greeting message.
   
2. **Response Structure**:
   - JSON response containing a greeting message.
   - Example:
     ```json
     {
       "message": "Hello, welcome to the Go Greet API!"
     }
     ```

3. **Port Configuration**: The application should listen on port `8080` by default, but this should be configurable.

#### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**: The application should have a low response time for the greeting request.
2. **Scalability**: Ensure the application is built in a way that can be easily scaled horizontally.
3. **Code Quality**: Follow best practices for code structure and documentation in Go.
4. **Error Handling**: The API should handle errors gracefully, with meaningful error messages and HTTP status codes.
5. **Testing**: Provide unit tests for the `/greet` endpoint to verify it returns the correct message.

### Implementation Details

1. **Framework**: Use Goâ€™s `net/http` package to handle HTTP requests.
2. **Structure**: Follow a standard Go project structure with folders for `handlers`, `config`, and `main` functions.
3. **Logging**: Include basic logging for incoming requests and any errors.
4. **Environment Configuration**: Allow the port to be set through an environment variable.

### Milestones

1. **Project Setup**: Initialize the project structure and dependencies.
2. **Endpoint Development**: Create the `/greet` endpoint with a hardcoded greeting message.
3. **Configuration and Logging**: Add configuration for port and basic logging.
4. **Testing**: Write unit tests for the `/greet` endpoint.
5. **Documentation**: Document the code and provide a README with setup instructions.

### Deliverables
- Go application with `/greet` endpoint.
- Configuration and logging setup.
- Unit tests for the `/greet` endpoint.
- README file with setup and usage instructions.

### Example Usage
After starting the application, a GET request to `http://localhost:8080/greet` should return:
```json
{
  "message": "Hello, welcome to the Go Greet API!"
}
```
